Exercise 1 : Hello World
========================

This exercise does not require that you use the machines at the real-time lab. However, the C code uses POSIX, so you'll need a POSIX-compliant OS, like linux or OSX.

[Go](http://golang.org) has an [interactive "Tour"](http://tour.golang.org/list) you can take. Go's syntax is a bit different, so it may be worth skimming through, or at least using as a quick reference.

## Parts
- [Part 1: Thinking about elevators](./Part1/README.md)
- [Part 2: Set up source control and build tools](./Part2/README.md)
- [Part 3: Reasons for concurrency and parallelism](./Part3/README.md)
- [Part 4: Finally some code](./Part4/README.md)

## Approval
When asking for approval, make sure to prepare the following.
- Part 3:
    - The modified file with answers filled in. You should open it at github or some other place where the markdown will be rendered nicely.
- Part 4:
    - The RESULT.md file where you have written a couple of sentances explaining the result you get. (HINT: You're suppose to discover some weirdness, and you might have to run your program several times to trigger it).
    - A terminal where you can run your code while the student assistant is watching.
