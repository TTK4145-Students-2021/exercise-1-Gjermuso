Exercise 1 - Theory questions
-----------------------------
 
 ### What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?
 > Concurrency is where you perform multiple tasks at the same time, but on a single thread. The tasks then shares the processing power, but does not compute at the same time, just alternating the computations. Parallelism is where you perform multiple tasks on multiple threads, allowing you to compute multiple tasks at the same time no waiting for the other task to free up the processor).
 
 ### Why have machines become increasingly multicore in the past decade?
 > 
 
 ### Why do we divide software (programs) into concurrently executing parts (like threads or processes)?
 (Or phrased differently: What problems do concurrency help in solving?)
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### Does creating concurrent programs make the programmer's life easier? Harder? Maybe both?
 (Come back to this after you have worked on part 4 of this exercise)

 ### What is the conceptual difference between threads and processes?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### Some languages support "fibers" (sometimes called "green threads") or "coroutines"? What are they?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### What is the Go-language's "goroutine"? A C/POSIX "pthread"?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### In Go, what does `func GOMAXPROCS(n int) int` change? 
 > *Your answer here*
