# Version Control

If you can read this text you have already taken your first steps in starting to use a version control system.

A version control system is a tool helps a group of people work on the same files in a systematic and safe manner, allowing multiple users to make changes to the same file and merge the changes later. It is also possible to create diverging branches so that multiple independent areas of development can happen in parallel, then have these merged together safely at a later time. Version control systems also keep track of all previous versions of files, so that you can revert any or all changes made since a given date.

In this course we will be using Github Classroom, where you will find the assignment texts, project description, and all the code related to the project. You will be given private repositories on the TTK4145 organization, which means that teachers and student assistants will have access to your code by default. You can create issues that reference specific assignment tasks or part of your project code while tagging the student assistants to get their attention.

You will not be able to complete this exercise without a very basic practical understanding of git. Unless you're already familiar with git, it's highly recommended to have a look at the following resources before moving on to Part 3 and 4. Don't let the feeling that you have to google everything discourage you, this is perfectly fine, even expected. And don't forget that the student assistants are there to help you.

- Do the [interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/)
- Play the [Git Game](https://www.git-game.com/)
- [Feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

Some prefer the command line while some prefer something graphical, both is fine. An overview of graphical git clients can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux).
